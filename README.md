This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This is my personal site using create-react-app. It is hosted on heroku at https://blake-spencer-projects.herokuapp.com/classification with a Flask app backend. You can see the github for the backend here: https://github.com/blakespencer/personal-site-backend

I hope you enjoy the site
