This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This is my personal site using create-react-app
<br>
It is hosted on heroku at:
<br>
https://blake-spencer-projects.herokuapp.com/classification
<br>

The backend is using a Python server with flask that sends the static build file of React. The repository is located here:

I hope you enjoy the site
